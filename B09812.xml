            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <l>THrice Welcome to <hi>London,</hi> that Renowned Prince,</l>
               <l>Who freely stood up for the Nations Defence:</l>
               <l>Nay, when we were sinking and ready to fall,</l>
               <l>Then did he step in and Deliver us all;</l>
               <l>When we on the brink of sad Ruine did stand,</l>
               <l>'Twas done by a M<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>hty Miraculous Hand:</l>
               <l>He but little Blood in this Nation did spill,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The Great Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> may Heaven bless still.</hi>

            <lg>
               <l>He is not Ambitious of wearing the Crown,</l>
               <l>But still does design to keep <hi>Popery</hi> down;</l>
               <l>And therefore he ventur'd o're Tempestuous Seas,</l>
               <l>When he might have tarry'd at home at his ease:</l>
               <l>But 'twas for our good, as it well does appear,</l>
               <l>That he was so Graciously pleas'd to come here:</l>
               <l>No Trouble nor Danger his Courage could kill,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The Great Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> may Heaven bless still.</hi>

            <lg>
               <l>To stand for Religion is all his Design,</l>
               <l>His heart is so Gracious, so Good and Divine,</l>
               <l>And therefore in pity, he came to subdue</l>
               <l>Those Troubles and Dangers he fear'd wou'd ensue:</l>
               <l>'Twas time to stand up for the <hi>Protestant</hi> Cause,</l>
               <l>When as they endeavour'd to make void our Laws;</l>
               <l>But yet I do hope they shall ne'r have their Will,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The Great Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> may Heaven bless still.</hi>

            <lg>
               <l>With loud Acclamations he was Welcom'd in,</l>

               <l>While Bells they are Ringing, and Trumpets do sound,</l>
               <l>The Kings Health and Prince does go merrily round:</l>
               <l>For I hope that he ne'r will endeavour to wrong</l>
               <l>Our Monarch Great <hi>James,</hi> who to us does belong,</l>
               <l>But settle our Laws by the best of his skill,</l>

               <l>Behaving themselves here most gallant and brave,</l>
               <l>Both Silver and Gold in their Pockets they have;</l>
               <l>They come not to burthen this Nation at all,</l>
               <l>But freely they pay for what ever they call;</l>
               <l>By which they have purchas'd the Nations Good-will,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The Great Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> may Heaven bless still.</hi>

            <lg>
               <l>There's each drooping Soul which did formerly grieve,</l>
               <l>They having much reason, alas! to believe</l>
               <l>That <hi>Popery</hi> over the Nation wou'd spread;</l>
               <l>This filled their hearts with much sorrow and dread:</l>
               <l>And yet when our hopes they were quite at an end,</l>
               <l>The Lord he in mercy, his Church did defend:</l>
               <l>Then let e'ry Christian submit to his Will,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>And pray that the Prince may be Prosperous still.</hi>
